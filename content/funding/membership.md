# Sustaining Membership program

QGIS is an entirely Open Source project. QGIS development is carried out largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, valuable and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. 

As a result, you have free access to the source code and binaries that we provide on our web site. As a result of this volunteer approach, a number of tasks, less interesting or important for the developers, are sometimes left behind. In addition, promoting QGIS requires our participation at congresses and conferences and the production of information material, sometimes very expensive for volunteer developers.


## Sustaining membership

At or above the following levels a sustaining member will be designated as being one of the following category, based on their size and assigned through self declaration:

Sustaining memberships last one year, after which they may be continued with a new payment, or allowed to lapse. Sustaining members have no voting rights (unless they are simultaneously voting members in which case their voting rights are unaffected).

Membership fees are approved or changed by the QGIS general assembly. They are defined as minimum fees per category, but may be increased if the sustaining member chooses to do so.

Because QGIS.ORG is a world-wide project and different companies, NGOs or governmental organizations have different financial prospects, we do not enforce any membership levels - the organizations pick their own membership level based on self-assessment.

Acceptance of sustaining members shall be subject to the discretion and approval of The Board, who reserve the right to accept or reject applications for sustaining membership and ongoing support memberships as deemed appropriate.

##### About ‘earmarked’ funding
We regret that we cannot accept ‘earmarked’ funding as it creates many administrative issues. If you are interested in funding specific aspects of QGIS development, we encourage you to allocate additional human resources to the project, e.g. hiring a developer, or participating to our bug fixing initiative.

{{< rich-content-start themeClass="coloring-6" >}}
##### Warning
Acceptance of sustaining membership applications is at the discretion of the QGIS PSC. We reserve the right to decline offers of sustaining members if the membership organisation or party seems to be at odds with the ethos of our project. For example offers from marketing companies that have nothing to do with GIS / spatial services, or offers where we have reason to believe the presence of the sustaining member logo and marketing materials on our site and other materials will degrade the experience of our users will be declined.
