# Donors
Donations can be of any amount, via our bank account, Stripe or Paypal (information available at [Donations]({{< ref "/funding/donate.md" >}}) page). Even a small donation can make a difference and help to reach important project goals!

If you wish to send us a larger donation, you are strongly encouraged to use the bank account or stripe (if you want to do credit card payments) rather than PayPal (they have higher payment fees and an unnecessary currency conversion is involved). Please contact [finance@qgis.org](mailto:finance@qgis.org) if you want to pay larger amounts with credit cards through Stripe. We can send you a payment link and/or invoice.

Donations to QGIS are tax-deductible in several countries. Please refer to your local tax office for details.
