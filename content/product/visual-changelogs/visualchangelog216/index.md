# Changelog for QGIS 2.16 {#changelog216}

![image1](images/projects/b4bbe21d5002a4b73ba27f5abf4e4aaea61d161f.png)

Release date: 2016-07-08

This is the log for the next release of QGIS - version 2.16.0 \'Nødebo\'. The Department of Geoscience and Natural Resource Management Forest and Landscape College in Nødebo were hosts to the First International QGIS conference and developer meeting in May 2015.

**This is not a Long Term Release**

This release is not designated as a Long Term Release (LTR). Users wishing to have a version of QGIS which does not change and receives bug fixes for at least 1 year are invited to use the current LTR release 2.14 (which now becomes our official LTR with the release of QGIS 2.16).

**New Features in QGIS 2.16 \'Nødebo\'**

If you are upgrading from QGIS 2.14 you will find a great many new features in this release. We encourage you to peruse the changelogs for [previous releases](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelogs.html) as this QGIS 2.16 release includes all features published in those releases too.

Whenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a ticket [on the QGIS Bug Tracker](http://hub.qgis.org).

## General

### Feature: Copying features in GeoJSON format

The previous setting for include WKT when copying features has been replaced with a choice of copying features as \"Plain text, attributes only\", \"Plain text, WKT geometry\" and a new \"GeoJSON\" option. When set to \"GeoJSON\", copying features in QGIS will place a GeoJSON text representation of the features on the clipboard for easy pasting into other applications/JavaScript code. These settings can be found in the `Settings -> Options -> Data Sources -> Copy features as`.

This feature was developed by [Stéphane Brunner](http://www.camptocamp.com/)

### Feature: Support for GNSS GNRMC messages

QGIS can now handle GLONASS satellite data (\$GN\* lines) to get a more precise Position from external GPS/GNSS Receivers.

![image97](images/entries/thumbnails/9d13c0c632da1e70199f035ce5a186c018da2cef.png.400x300_q85_crop.jpg)

This feature was developed by Ondřej Fibich

### Feature: Paste GeoJSON features directly into QGIS

QGIS clipboard handler can now parse many additional text formats, including native support for GeoJSON feature collections. This allows you to directly copy and paste GeoJSON strings into QGIS and have them automatically converted into QGIS features and geometries.

![image98](images/entries/b649df59dc031b26896e9bba2e20c8380081b741.gif)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Map tip improvements

-   Maptip visibility is now preserved across sessions
-   Maptips can now show HTML content, including images, videos and URL links

![image99](images/entries/thumbnails/96467c2c86ede6392190f021d266ee0e7ed6cbb5.png.400x300_q85_crop.jpg)

This feature was funded by [OPENGIS.ch GmbH](http://www.opengis.ch)

This feature was developed by [Marco Bernasocchi (OpenGIS.ch)](http://www.opengis.ch)

### Feature: Desktop MIME icons for QGIS file types

It\'s now easier to recognise and differentiate QGIS\'s file types on your operating system files manager. There are now desktop MIME Icons for the following file types:

-   \*.qgs - QGIS Project file
-   \*.qml - Layer settings file
-   \*.qlr - Layer definitions file
-   \*.qpt - Composer template file

![image100](images/entries/thumbnails/9161a4c36a0149b32cd18119954ac32ce42788a6.PNG.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Alexandre Neto](https://gisunchained.wordpress.com/)

## User Interface

### Feature: Map canvas magnifier

A magnifier tool has been added to QGIS, which allows you to magnify the map at a given scale. This allows you to zoom in to a map without altering the map scale, making it easier to accurately tweak the positions of labels and symbols. Additionally, a default magnification value can be defined in settings, which is very useful for high resolution screens!

![image41](images/entries/4991ffccebf8da94cd01acc1139f52d389731549.gif)

This feature was funded by [the QWAT project](https://github.com/qwat)

This feature was developed by [Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)](http://oslandia.com/)

### Feature: Improvements to map zooming

QGIS 2.16 brings improvements to the way you can zoom in and out of the map canvas.

-   Holding down `Ctrl` while using the mouse wheel to zoom in or out now results in a finer zoom. This behavior brings canvas into line with composer.
-   Pressing `Ctrl++` or `Ctrl+-` performs an immediate zoom in/out on the map canvas
-   When certain map tools are active, you can perform a web-map style zoom by holding down `Shift` and dragging a rectangle on the map to zoom to that area. This is enabled for the map tools which are not selection tools (since they use shift for adding to selection), and edit tools.

![image42](images/entries/5817785cf3d18db78669c2eb2c2be0cf606c3783.gif)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Redesigned interactive gradient editor

The gradient ramp editor has been reworked with interactive controls for easier manipulation of gradients. The dialog now also includes an interactive plot for modifying gradient stops via the color HSV or RGB values. The new editor features:

-   drag to move color stops
-   double clicking to add a new stop
-   pressing delete will remove the selected stop
-   pressing arrow keys will move the selected stop, and holding shift while pressing a cursor key results in a larger move
-   drag and drop a color onto the widget to add a new stop

![image43](images/entries/dca557436392cf51e05a0c77fa915b5e94013d2c.gif)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Choice of default view for the attribute dialog

In previous QGIS versions the attribute dialog would always be opened in the table view. Now, you have the choice of always defaulting the dialog to either the table view, form view or to remember the last view used.

![image44](images/entries/53f72a9cf1bf32d73eb5174c37e54c60002b9707.gif)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Improvements to calendar popups

Today\'s date is now highlighted in calendar popup widgets, making it easier to select a date relative to the current day.

![image45](images/entries/83b0414698c309c7afacb9da1b01370cff94497d.gif)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Improved color pickers

The color button dropdown menus now show a color wheel, allowing for very rapid adustments to colors.

![image46](images/entries/1f485fa58f218aa481acf0c118907a1cd60fd682.gif)

This feature was developed by [Nathan Woodrow](http://nathanw.net)

### Feature: Copy cell contents from attribute table

A new context menu item called `Copy cell content` is now available in the menu opened by a right click on a cell within the attribute table. When this button is clicked, the content of the cell is copied in the clipboard, whatever the kind of widget.

![image47](images/entries/thumbnails/968170742ce1d075c6ab1c462e682ea4fd8c5225.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)](http://oslandia.com/)

### Feature: Improved HiDPI support

HiDPI screen users will notice an improved user interface as more work has been done to upgrade icons to rely on SVG images. As of QGIS 2.16, all toolbars are now HiDPI-compatible.

![image48](images/entries/thumbnails/e60e55de87e8d2558134f9c9552ef41295642217.png.400x300_q85_crop.jpg)

This feature was developed by [Mathieu Pellerin](http://imhere-asia.com/)

### Feature: Improved map select tool behaviour

The behavior of the map based selection tools has been refined, with the following changes:

For click-and-drag selections:

-   holding `Shift` = add to selection
-   holding `Ctrl` = subtract from selection
-   holding `Ctrl+Shift` = intersect with current selection
-   holding `Alt` (can be used with `Shift`/`Ctrl` too) = change from \"intersects\" to \"fully contains\" selection mode

For single-click selections:

-   holding `Shift` or `Ctrl` = toggle whether feature is selected (i.e. either add to current selection or remove from current selection)

This change brings the canvas behavior into line with other design apps and also with the composer behavior.

## Documentation Updates

### Feature: QGIS 2.14 Documentation

Having now an automatic way to create a ticket in the documentation repository for each new feature in QGIS, we are sure that all new features is now in the documentation.

The documentation team worked hard on three releases of QGIS: 2.10, 2.12 and 2.14 so the documentation is now up to date for the current Long Term Release of QGIS. This is around 180 new features that have been documented in 4 months.

If you think there are some missing features in the documentation, feel free to add a new ticket, write small text to describe it or better push a contribution.

The documentation team has also worked on improving the documentation guidelines in order to ease contribution\'s process for new doc writers and help translators.

The documentation team will now work hard the next months to document the current stable release (2.16) of QGIS.

![image51](images/entries/thumbnails/3d6aea22a76278945fcbaebcb6e959c6f4f8790e.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

Check the 2.10, 2.12 and 2.14 milestone to see all the documentation work that has taken place:

-   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/milestone/4>
-   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/milestone/3>

### Feature: Authentication system\'s documentation in users manual

The authentication system features introduced in earlier versions of QGIS (2.12 and 2.14) are now fully documented in the Users manual, and will be a great contribute to the system\'s understanding and adoption.

![image50](images/entries/thumbnails/2408c7661583ab3114123624225f8f8422c634a3.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was funded by [Boundless](http://boundlessgeo.com/)

This feature was developed by Larry Shaffer

## Symbology

### Feature: Arrow symbol layer

The \"arrow\" symbol layer is a symbol layer allowing to draw straight or curved arrows from a line layer.

In curved mode, nodes of the line layer this symbol layer is applied to are used as control points for circle arcs. Arrows can be filled with whatever existing filling style QGIS supports. Options also allows to select the type of the arrow (with one or two heads, plain or halved), its width (that may be variable) and size of the heads.

![image52](images/entries/thumbnails/000cc7827fe96aa72aedb646e6497cc69a050396.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was funded by [MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/) and Andreas Neumann

This feature was developed by [Hugo Mercier](http://oslandia.com/)

### Feature: New \"Filled marker\" symbol layer type

A \"filled marker\" is similar to the simple marker symbol layer, except that it uses a fill sub symbol to render the marker. This allows use of all the existing QGIS fill (and outline) styles for rendering markers, eg gradient or shapeburst fills.

![image53](images/entries/thumbnails/6107e2a6192e6d459fce2f0a1d9da99680dc53b0.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: New accessibility and low vision symbols

Additional accessibility and low visions symbols are now available in QGIS\' SVG symbols collection.

![image54](images/entries/thumbnails/7f6fc338b6f85fb59cd6e5e79b27899724e1c33e.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Mathieu Pellerin](http://imhere-asia.com/)

### Feature: New simple marker symbols

-   semicircle, third, quarter circles
-   half triangle markers
-   filled cross and hexagon markers
-   diamond ellipse marker

![image55](images/entries/thumbnails/e5f7ea942c155a0a8dff05c60aca0f299907ee02.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Mathieu Pellerin](http://imhere-asia.com/)

### Feature: \"No symbol\" renderer

Using the new \"No symbol\" renderer in QGIS 2.16 no symbol will be drawn for features, but labeling, diagrams and other non-symbol parts will still be shown.

Selections can still be made on the layer in the canvas and selected features will be rendered with a default symbol. Features being edited will also be shown.

This is intended as a handy shortcut for layers which you only want to show labels or diagrams for, and avoids the need to render symbols with totally transparent fill/border to achieve this. It may not sound useful from the title - but it\'s quite a handy shortcut!

![image56](images/entries/thumbnails/4e02691b64446f5a36f4faf3cc4906726cf57aad.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: More control over centroid fill point rendering

An option has been added to control whether the marker is drawn on all parts or a single part of multi-features.

![image57](images/entries/thumbnails/1a5e1daeefff5beb028c3230fffd86624974acea.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Mathieu Pellerin](http://imhere-asia.com/)

### Feature: Outline setting for font markers symbol

Font markers symbol can now have outline, which can help increasing visibility of such symbols by adding an outline buffer color. Emoji-enabled font characters can serve as nice markers when used with a thick outline.

![image58](images/entries/thumbnails/be266e3dace9cc7011bfea6bab34ee8e4ade414e.jpeg.400x300_q85_crop.jpg)

This feature was developed by [Mathieu Pellerin](http://imhere-asia.com/)

### Feature: Control outline join style for simple, ellipse, and font markers

Users can now change the join style of outlines for simple, ellipse, and font markers to fine-tune their symbology.

![image59](images/entries/thumbnails/c6b3a2f051a8c4e3f82c5cb6a995ae150acccb4b.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Mathieu Pellerin](http://imhere-asia.com/)

### Feature: New map tool for interactively setting point symbol offset

Allows for setting a point\'s offset if it is bound to a field using data defined overrides. The offset field should be a text field. The map tool to interactively set the offset is in the `Advanced digitizing` toolbar in the icon group with the `Rotate Point Symbols` tool. See the attached animation for an example. Note that when making subsequent adjustments to the offset, you should drag from the original point vertex marker, not the current position of the symbol as rendered on the map.

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Style Dock

The style dock is a new, far more efficient, way to manage layer styles in QGIS. It supports a live preview of style changes as they are made, full undo / redo support and a less distracted workflow as you prepare your map cartography. For a comprehensive overview of the style dock\'s features, please see [style dock part 1](https://nathanw.net/2016/06/25/improving-you-styling-with-the-qgis-style-dock-part-1/) and [style dock part 2](https://nathanw.net/2016/06/29/qgis-style-dock-part-2-plugin-panels/).

This feature was developed by [Nathan Woodrow](https://nathanw.net/)

## Labelling

### Feature: Labeling map tools now work with rule-based labeling

In previous versions of QGIS when rule-based labeling was in place, you could not use the labeling map tools to interactively place and rotate label positions. This is now supported.

![image62](images/entries/fffc27648a04732d7d051734705ccef544b24fba.gif)

This feature was developed by Martin Dobias

## Diagrams

### Feature: Legend entries for diagram size

A new \"legend\" tab has been added to diagram properties, allowing both the existing attribute legend and a new size legend to be enabled/disabled. The size legend has a configurable marker symbol.

![image63](images/entries/thumbnails/eb51ab12f096acf0422786510fc15324060fe9e1.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was funded by [ADUGA](http://www.aduga.org/)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Unit selection for outline width

Outline width unit selection is now available. This allows for a map unit sized diagram that will grow and shrink based on map scale while maintaining a fixed millimeter outline width.

![image64](images/entries/thumbnails/932c792c43a94b8236ea803ae334c1a3d9f447ef.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Mathieu Pellerin](http://imhere-asia.com/)

### Feature: Diagrams behave like labels and can be managed from toolbar

Originally, there was a toolbar for labels allowing to:

-   set labeling options for labels of the current layer
-   highlight the pinned labels. Highlighting is green on editable layer, blue otherwise.
-   pin or unpin labels
-   move, show and hide labels

With this new feature, a new tool is available in the label toolbar allowing to set properties of diagrams for the current layer. Moreover, each tool mentioned above are now fully usable with diagrams too.

![image65](images/entries/thumbnails/eb337b7d02cd7ecb923134de80a63aa62c3e8bb8.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was funded by [MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/)

This feature was developed by [Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)](http://oslandia.com/)

## Rendering

### Feature: New options for on the fly simplification

The user can select the algorithm to use when the local-side simplification runs to draw geometries faster. Now, QGIS provides three algorithms:

-   Distance (default algorithm, and the only option available in previous QGIS releases)
-   SnapToGrid
-   Visvalingam

This change also moves the local \"on-the-fly\" simplification from the provider and iterator classes to the rendering code. This avoids cases where simplification changes the geometry fetched from vector data providers, possibly affecting rule based and other expression based symbology. This is important when you have expressions that use the feature geometry (e.g. calculation of area) - we want to be sure that these calculations are done on the original geometry, not on the simplified ones.

![image66](images/entries/thumbnails/9460e7d5f10a8c89697cef1f80674ca30d1c3aef.jpg.400x300_q85_crop.jpg)

This feature was developed by [Alvaro Huarte](https://es.linkedin.com/in/alvarohuarte)

### Feature: Quantile based classification for raster layers

This option can be found for single band pseudocolor rasters in the classification `mode` dialog.

![image67](images/entries/thumbnails/844d12273c1d3d42e5f1b20367e92bc1144b77fe.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by Piers Titus van der Torren

### Feature: Live hillshade renderer

QGIS 2.16 has a new raster renderer that will dynamically create a hillshade model from a Digital Elevation Model.

![image68](images/entries/62f9492d1949677e316625b415ec732e63fcd3ec.gif)

This feature was developed by Asger Skovbo Petersen and Nathan Woodrow

## Digitizing

### Feature: \"Repeating\" locking mode for constraints

When enabled, repeating locks are not automatically cleared when a new point is added. They are handy when the same constraint must be repeated for multiple points (eg adding vertices which are always 50 meters apart). This functionality is available in the `Advanced Digitizing Panel`.

![image69](images/entries/f7dced55540bf500c4d9ca5a0efa9bef617c86e5.gif)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Extend linestring geometries with reshape tool

The reshape tool now allows you to extend linestrings, by starting a reshape at either a line\'s start or end point.

![image70](images/entries/52726f3b8cd8b62d63a32b9628dd8d3cef53172c.gif)

This feature was developed by Martin Dobias

### Feature: Segmentation tolerance

Support was added to set the segmentation tolerance (maximum angle or maximum difference). This setting controls the way circular arcs are rendered. The smaller maximum angle (in degrees) or maximum difference (in map units), the more straight line segments will be used during rendering. You can find this option in `Settings -> Options -> Rendering -> Curve Segmentation`.

![image71](images/entries/thumbnails/c86e3cd9ebab19e1581568eb5804c69ba279787d.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler

## Data Management

### Feature: New configuration options for attribute table

-   Allow reordering the attribute table columns (via right click on field name header \--\> \"Organize Columns\" dialog; drag and drop to reorder)
-   Allow adding a new column to the attribute table to hold buttons for triggering an action based on the chosen feature
-   Columns can be hidden from the attribute table (via right click on field name header)
-   QGIS now remembers the width of any resized columns

![image72](images/entries/4ac86473163c0b1e322343de1e4013262c2492ce.gif)

This feature was funded by [Canton of Zug, Switzerland](http://geo.zg.ch/) and [MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/)

This feature was developed by [Stéphane Brunner (Camptocamp)](http://www.camptocamp.com/) and [Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)](http://www.opengis.ch/)

### Feature: Multiple columns in attribute forms

When using the drag and drop designer, a user can specify over how many columns the fields should be distributed.

To enable multiple columns in the \"Fields\" tab of the layer properties:

-   Make sure you are using the drag and drop designer form mode
-   Double click group containers, such as tabs or groups
-   a small dialog will appear where you can select the nr of columns

The order will be first column, second column, nth column, next row, etc.

This feature was funded by [Canton of Zug, Switzerland](http://geo.zg.ch/)

This feature was developed by [Matthias Kuhn](http://www.opengis.ch/)

### Feature: Control over attributes to export when saving a vector layer

Checkboxes have been added so that you can select which attributes you want included in the export, and you also now have the option to write \"displayed\" values rather than raw values. This option is useful for layers with relations, where you\'d like a literal value included rather than a numeric identifier.

Depending on the data format, the \"displayed value\" is enabled by default, e.g. for export to spreadsheet formats (ODF, XLSX, CSV/Text).

![image74](images/entries/thumbnails/1c9b2b234c1ccb7a1b92af1f5856817f65dc70f1.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was partially funded by [Canton of Zug, Switzerland](http://geo.zg.ch/)

This feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer, Even Rouault

### Feature: Forms view: side column now sortable

In the forms mode of the QGIS attribute table there is a side column one can use to directly jump to a specific feature. Up-to this release, this side view was not sortable. For sorting, one had to jump to the table mode and then back to the form mode. Now one can directly sort the feature by the feature attribute preview in the side panel by chosing the sort function on the expression drop-down button above the side column.

### Feature: Relation reference widget: shortcut for adding new values

The relation reference widget was enhanced to allow quicker extensions of related value lists. If the checkbox \"Allow adding new features\" is enabled in the widget properties (access through \"Fields\" tab in layer properties), a green plus button will appear to the right of the widget. After pressing the \"Plus\" button, the dialog of the related table will open in \"new record\" mode where one can add an additional entry.

This feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer

### Feature: Top level widgets in drag and drop designer

It is now possible to put widgets directly on the form with the drag and drop designer. A drag and drop designer form can therefore exist without any tabs on it.

![image78](images/entries/thumbnails/720df275d40a2d527f2492bde7db4dcdc94fc3da.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Matthias Kuhn](http://www.opengis.ch)

### Feature: Form based select and filter

In QGIS 2.16 a new mode was added to the attribute table dialog for searching and filtering features. When activated (using a button on the toolbar or by pressing `CTRL+F`), the dialog will switch to form view and all widgets are replaced with their search widget wrapper variant.

Alongside each widget is a tool button with options for controlling the search/filter behaviour for that field, eg \"equal to\", \"not equal to\", \"is null\", \"greater than\", etc.., with the options presented matching themselves to the corresponding field and widget type.

New buttons appear at the bottom of the form for either selecting matching features (with options for add to selection/remove from selection/select within current selection) or filtering features in the table (with options for adding features to a current filter or further restricting a current filter).

You can also access this mode with the new \"Select by Value\" option, or by pressing F3 with a layer selected.

### Feature: Create GeoPackage layers

The [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org) format is an open standard for geospatial data that should be on your radar as a replacement for the ESRI Shapefile format. It addresses many shortcomings with the shape file format including limitations in the number and width of fields. In QGIS 2.16 it is now easy to create a new GeoPackage as it has been integrated into the `Layer` toolbar and `Layer -> Create Layer` menu.

![image80](images/entries/thumbnails/34cfb4a4532464ab1983e561228a9a16d16dfd54.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by Even Rouault

### Feature: Constraints on widgets

In previous QGIS versions there was no way to check the validity of values entered by a user for a feature\'s attributes. Now, a user can specify a constraint on each widget in a layer\'s attribute form. Constraints are created using QGIS\' expressions, eg `"min_population" > 50000`. A \"Not Null\" checkbox is also available to indicate that a value must be entered for the field. Additionally, descriptive text can be added to give the user helpful feedback when a constraint fails.

Constraints are evaluated on the fly while a user is modifying a feature. A tooltip is available on any field having a constraint, showing the constraint\'s expression, the result of the evaluation and a description of the constraint. A message bar will also displayed at the top of the form summarizing any fields which do not meet the constraint criteria.

### Feature: Edit attributes of multiple features simultaneously

This change allows the attributes of multiple features to be edited simultaneously. It is enabled when the attribute table dialog is in \"form mode\", via a new \"multi edit\" button on the toolbar. There\'s also a shortcut to edit multiple selected features by using `Edit -> Modify Attributes of Selected Features`.

In this mode, attribute value changes will apply to all selected features. New widgets appear next to each editor widget allowing for display of the current multi-edit state and for rolling back changes on a field-by-field basis.

Changes are made as a single edit command, so pressing undo will rollback the attribute changes for all selected features at once.

Multiedit mode is only available for auto generated and drag and drop forms -it is not supported by custom ui forms.

## Layer Legend

### Feature: New option to zoom to a layer\'s visible scale range

For layers with a visible scale range set, selecting this option will automatically set the scale to the closest scale where the layer is visible. Additionally, the interface has been tweaked so that layers which are outside their scale range and hidden are shown greyed out in the layer tree.

This feature was developed by [Patrick Valsecchi (Camptocamp)](http://www.camptocamp.com/)

## Map Composer

### Feature: New tools for drawing polygons and polylines

Two new types of composer shape items, based on nodes, are now available in the map composer. Using these you can draw polygons or polylines within your composition in just a few clicks.

New tools have also been added to allow editing nodes (ie move or remove nodes) and also to add new nodes to an existing shape. Composer polygon and polyline items can also be styled using all the symbol styles available for line and polygon layers!

![image84](images/entries/thumbnails/52e5ebd093c119ee882b1c354fefc97f5e823ffc.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)](http://oslandia.com/)

### Feature: Relative links in composer labels

Now labels and HTML boxes can contain relative URLs. If we don\'t have a base URL, the project file will be used as a base URL.

This feature was developed by [Patrick Valsecchi (Camptocamp)](http://www.camptocamp.com/)

### Feature: Embed atlas features into composer HTML source as GeoJSON

This change makes the current atlas feature (and additionally all attributes of related child features) available to the source of a composer HTML item, allowing the item to dynamically adjust its rendered HTML in response to the feature\'s properties. An example use case is dynamically populating a HTML table with all the attributes of related child features for the atlas feature.

To use this, the HTML source must implement a \"setFeature(feature)\" JavaScript function. This function is called whenever the atlas feature changes, and is passed the atlas feature (and all related attributes) as a GeoJSON Feature.

This feature was funded by [Canton of Zug, Switzerland](http://geo.zg.ch/)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com/)

### Feature: Parameterized svg support for composer svg images

This change makes it possible to change an SVG files fill and outline colors, and outline width when using parameterised SVG files such as those included with QGIS. For more details on parameterised SVG files see [this article](http://blog.sourcepole.ch/2011/06/30/svg-symbols-in-qgis-with-modifiable-colors/).

![image87](images/entries/thumbnails/f9766e2ad952c9a3d4a7fe2ddbdfa20d63b2aff4.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Easier use of HTML in labels

In QGIS 2.16, the base stylesheet of composer labels will automatically set the label font and margins to match the label\'s settings. This allows interactive choice of font, margins and colors and avoids the need to manually set these with CSS within the label HTML code.

![image88](images/entries/thumbnails/d078efbe63f71e8bdf28d476f9da0396f4b7dc0a.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Georeference outputs (eg PDF) from composer

In QGIS 2.16 the map composer automatically georeferences outputs (when the output format makes this possible, eg TIF and PDF).

The existing option to create a world file has been separated from the map selection for georeferencing. The new behaviour is to always georeference outputs, and only create the separate world file if that option is checked.

![image89](images/entries/thumbnails/e05ee773025d69f028f01ffa15521578be7d3dc3.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Composer maps now auto-update with presets

When a composer map is set to follow a style preset, it will automatically be updated whenever the style is changed.

A new option has been added in composer map properties: \"Follow visibility preset\" with a combo box to choose the active preset. This is an alternative to \"lock layers\" (and \"lock layer styles\") functionality which just copy a preset\'s configuration, while this new option creates a link to the preset.

The difference is that when a preset is updated, composer map will automatically pick the new configuration when following the preset, while there is no update if \"lock layers\" (and \"lock layer styles\") option is used.

## Analysis Tools

### Feature: Named parameters in expressions

In QGIS 2.16 the expression engine now supports use of named parameters. This means that instead of writing the cryptic expression: `clamp(1,2,3)` you can use: `clamp( min:=1, value:=2, max:=3)`. This change also allows arguments to be switched, eg: `clamp( value:=2, max:=3, min:=1)`.

Using named parameters helps clarify what the arguments for an expression function refer to, which is helpful when you are trying to interpret an expression at a later date!

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: More distance units

The choice of distance units has been widened, with new options including kilometers, yards and miles. Using these units prevents the need for manual conversion of distances (eg feet to miles).

![image91](images/entries/thumbnails/a550363f123d3bf08bd53fef79dc92559ae8965d.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Changes to expressions

-   Support `date + time` = datetime calculations
-   Support for `date - date`, `time - time` and `datetime - datetime` type calculations which return an interval.
-   New `char()` function for returning a matching character by unicode value

### Feature: Statistics for string and date fields

The statistical summary dock can now calculate aggregate statistics for string and date fields.

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Show curve point radius in info tool

If you click on a curved line using the info tool, QGIS will now display the radius in the info tool.

![image93](images/entries/thumbnails/70f085e8494b3f65fd801b79fe6e15fe4ec7f012.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler

### Feature: Aggregate support for expressions

QGIS 2.16 adds support for a several types of aggregates to the expression engine. These include:

1.  Aggregates within the current layer, eg `sum("passengers")` Supports sub expressions (ie `sum("passengers"/2)` ), group by ( `sum("passengers", group_by:="line_segment")` ), and optional filters ( `sum("passengers", filter:= "station_class" > 3 )` )
2.  Relational aggregates, which calculate an aggregate over all matching child features from a relation, eg `relation_aggregate( 'my_relation', 'mean', "some_child_field" )`
3.  A summary aggregate function, for calculating aggregates on other layers. Eg `aggregate('rail_station_layer','sum',"passengers")`. The summary aggregate function supports an optional filter, making it possible to calculate things like: `aggregate('rail_stations','sum',"passengers", intersects(@atlas_geometry, $geometry ) )` for calculating the total number of passengers for the stations inside the current atlas feature

In all cases the calculations are cached inside the expression context, so they only need to be calculated once for each set of expression evaluations.

This feature was funded by [Canton of Zug, Switzerland](http://geo.zg.ch/)

### Feature: fTools plugin has been replaced with Processing algorithms

fTools is a core plugin that for many years has provided the tools found in the `Vector` menu in QGIS. With the advent of the QGIS processing framework, the fTools began to represent a duplication of effort, and many of the tools have been improved in their Processing equivalents. To address, the fTools plugin has been removed from QGIS and equivalent menu entries have been added to the vector menu, pointing to the Processing framework tools that achieve the same thing.

![image94](images/entries/thumbnails/99f9e994013dd63cdbba44a765ae5b5a0595d533.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by Alex Bruy

## Processing

### Feature: Set point locations by clicking on canvas

Processing parameters expecting a point location can now be set via clicking a location on the map canvas. Previously, coordinates had to be manually entered.

This feature was developed by Alex Bruy

### Feature: Support for expressions and variables

Inputs and outputs in algorithm dialogs now support QGIS expressions and variables.

This feature was developed by Victor Olaya

### Feature: Preconfigured algorithms

Algorithms with preconfigured parameters can now be added to the Processing toolbox, as a shortcut for a given process.

This feature was developed by Victor Olaya

### Feature: Create a plugin with script-based algorithms from the toolbox

Previously, the only way to create a QGIS plugin which added new algorithms to Processing was to manually develop those algorithms and create a new algorithm provider. Now, algorithms can be written as simple Processing scripts, and a plugin containing them can be created directly from the Processing Toolbox. That plugin can be then distributed as a regular plugin, and will extend Processing when active.

This feature was developed by Victor Olaya

### Feature: Use of authentication manager in PostGIS related algorithms

PostGIS related algorithms now use QGIS authentication manager to get credentials for PostGIS database.

-   In case an authentication method has been set on PostGIS connection, user will be asked for his master password.
-   In case no authentication method has been set on connection, credentials will be taken from credentials cache or, if not found there, asked to the user and stored in credentials cache for further use.

With this, it is not longer necessary to store clear passwords in connection settings to use PostGIS related algorithms.

This feature was funded by [MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/)

This feature was developed by [Arnaud Morvan (Camptocamp)](http://www.camptocamp.com/)

### Feature: Support for writing tables with no geometry

The OutputVector algorithm now supports writing geometryless tables.

For now, this has only been applied on Refactor Fields algorithm but could easily extended to other attributes related algorithms.

This feature was funded by [MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/)

This feature was developed by [Arnaud Morvan (Camptocamp)](http://www.camptocamp.com/)

### Feature: Additional GRASS algorithms in processing

For this release, QGIS Processing now includes every [vector](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/vector.html), [raster](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/raster.html) and [imagery](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/imagery.html) algorithms from GRASS7. Now, there are more than 300 algorithms for you to use directly from the QGIS interface. You have all the power of GRASS7 directly incorporated into QGIS and you can mix GRASS7 algorithms with all other Processing algorithms without having to use a GRASS7 database.

Some unit tests (mostly for raster and imagery algorithms) have also been included for some algorithms, making bug detection easier to handle and to process.

Note that, for the moment, GRASS7 Processing algorithms can only use and produce Shapefile vector layers and GeoTiff rasters. There is also a limit for some GRASS7 raster algorithms (all of the algorithms that are manipulating color tables) which duplicate raster layers to temporary directories. Depending on the size of your source rasters, you will probably need some disk space to handle them.

This feature was developed by [Médéric Ribreux](https://medspx.fr)

## Data Providers

### Feature: OGR datasets are opened in read-only mode by default

Allows concurrent editing of Shapefiles and Tabfiles in both QGIS & MapInfo.

This feature was funded by [MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/)

This feature was developed by Even Rouault

### Feature: Improved handling of Postgres DOMAIN type fields

QGIS now shows the correct domain type as field type name, and is able to correctly determine the length and precision of domain types. See the PostgreSQL [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-createdomain.html) to find more information about DOMAIN types.

This feature was developed by [Nyall Dawson (North Road)](http://north-road.com)

### Feature: Make readOnly mode of vector layers configurable in project

Using this option, you can prevent users from inadvertently editing layers. Go to `Project properties -> Identify layers` to configure which layers should be presented as read only.

![image101](images/entries/thumbnails/9fce381bdf92bd039a26282a93579d5d5ef22e92.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was developed by [Matthias Kuhn](http://www.opengis.ch/)

### Feature: Support for DB2 databases

This feature was developed by David Adler

### Feature: Refresh Postgres materialized views in db manager

### Feature: OGR FID attribute shown

QGIS now exposes the OGR FID as first attribute when it is meaningful, eg for GPKG and other database based drivers.

This feature was developed by Even Rouault

### Feature: ArcGIS Map and Feature REST services

QGIS is now able to connect to ArcGIS REST services.

You can connect to ArcGIS Feature services (WFS equivalent in ESRI world) and ArcGIS Map services (WMS equivalent). The provider allows you to read maps and vector layers from those services.

This feature is quite convenient for users who would like to switch from an ESRI GIS stack without losing anything they already have built on private or public map services. You can also connect to public services provided by ESRI.

This feature was developed by [Jürgen Fischer for Faunalia](http://faunalia.it)

### Feature: Massive improvements to WFS Provider

QGIS 2.16 brings an overhaul of the WFS provider, including

-   Version autodetection
-   On-disk caching of downloaded features
-   Background download and progressive rendering
-   WFS 1.1 and 2.0 support
-   WFS 2.0 GetFeature paging
-   Add provider tests
-   Support for WFS 2.0 joins
-   URI parameter with sql with SELECT / FROM / JOIN / WHERE / ORDER BY clauses
-   Handle DateTime fields
-   Enable \"Only request features overlapping the view extent\" by default (and memorize the settings)
-   Support for additional/mixed geometry types (CurvePolygon, CompoundCurve)
-   More tolerance for non-conforming WFS servers

![image102](images/entries/thumbnails/d69f2cc2fcc59b26d830bb84c82d5e6c9d89beae.png.400x300_q85_crop.png)

This feature was funded by [Land Information New Zealand and Canton of Zug, Switzerland](http://www.linz.govt.nz/)

This feature was developed by [Even Rouault](http://www.spatialys.com/)

### Feature: Generation of default values on Postgres layers \"just in time\"

The expression used to generate default values for a field on the postgres database are currently being printed on the feature form.

    nextval('serial')

A new option in the \"project properties\" (tab \"Data Sources\") allows evaluating the expression before opening the form and will directly print the new value in the feature form.

    23

The main advantage of this improvement, is that one can now directly create and link records of related tables before having to save the data first, because the primary key is already present before the feature is saved.

This feature was developed by [Matthias Kuhn](http://www.opengis.ch)

## Programmability

### Feature: Embedded widgets in layer tree

This allows definition of widgets embedded into layer tree for individual layers in the layer properties dialog (in new Legend tab). The idea is to have a way to quickly access to some actions that are often used with a layer.

The implementation comes with transparency widget, in the future there may be more standard widgets coming, e.g. to setup filtering, selection, style or other stuff. The API allows plugins to register their own widgets, which will be useful for various domain specific plugins to assign custom widgets to layers they manage.
