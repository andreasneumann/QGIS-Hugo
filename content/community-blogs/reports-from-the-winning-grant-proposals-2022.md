<p>With the <a href="https://blog.qgis.org/2022/03/12/qgis-grant-programme-2022-results/">QGIS Grant Programme 2022</a>, we were able to support four proposals that are aimed to improve the QGIS project, including software, infrastructure, and documentation. The following reports summarize the work performed in the proposals.&nbsp;</p>

<li class="task-list-item enabled position-relative border-right-0 hovered"><span class="reference"><a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/243"><strong>Support building QGIS application on Qt 6</strong><span class="issue-shorthand"><strong> (#243)</strong></span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2022-August/009864.html" rel="nofollow">Report</a><br>In addition to the original plan of porting the &#8220;gui&#8221; and &#8220;app&#8221; libraries to Qt 6, it was possible to complete also the &#8220;3d&#8221; and &#8220;server&#8221; libraries. We now are at a stage where the majority of QGIS builds and runs without any significant issues on Qt 6. The Github CI setup has been updated to also run the C++ tests for gui, app, server and 3d, and the majority of these have been fixed so that they pass on the Qt 6 builds too. In addition, some tests which were failing under Qt 6 revealed some real QGIS bugs which have been fixed in the process of this work. (So there&#8217;s a direct benefit for the existing Qt 5 builds too!).</li>

The SQL logging was implemented for Postgres, GeoPackage, Spatialite and Oracle data providers. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142164/162021609-789a3603-d00f-45c7-80aa-1a4f6edda646.png" alt="immagine"></li>

There is a compatibility handling (both forward and backward). The GUI implementation will be worked on during the HF in NL this spring.</li>
<li class="task-list-item enabled position-relative border-right-0"><strong><span class="reference"><a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/247">Fix handling of provider default value clauses/Autogenerate/nextval(&#8230;) handling<span class="issue-shorthand"> (#247)</span></a></span>&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2022-October/009884.html" rel="nofollow">Report</a><br>The bulk of these changes landed in the QGIS 3.28 release. A quick way to demonstrate on of the issues fixed is: open a Geopackage file, start editing the layer, add some features to it, but don&#8217;t save the edits, then right click the edited layer and try to save it to a different file. On older QGIS releases you&#8217;ll be spammed with a number of error messages because we tried to write a string value of &#8220;Autogenerate&#8221; into a number field for all the newly created features. On QGIS 3.28 this all just works as expected, with no errors encountered.</li>

<p>Thank you to everyone who participated and made this round of grants a great success and thank you to all our <a href="{{< ref "/funding/membership.md" >}}">sustaining members</a> and donors who make this initiative possible!</p>
